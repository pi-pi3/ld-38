# Themes and brainstorming for Ludum Dare 38

## You control the game, not the player
- keyboard controls the world to solve puzzles
- you control the guardian angel who has to protect a drunken man on his way to another tavern

## On / Off
### Two Colors (simmilar to On / Off)
### Dark / Light (simmilar to On / Off and Two Colors)

## Parallel Dimensions
- puzzle, you have to stuff stuff into your closet pentomino-style, but you'll have to throw something into a parallel dimension, because there's no room

## Pausing has Consequences
- platformer, pausing pauses you, but not the world
- Puzzle, upychasz ubrania do szafy bo Twoja dziewczyna niespodziewanie ma przyjść (coś jak pentomino) tylko że jedą rzecz musisz wysłać do innego wymiaru bo inaczej się nie zmieści

## Keep it Alive
- tamagotchi-esque game
- td

## Island
- sink the Atlantis!

## A World in the Skies
- olympian gods racing

## You are Alone

## Inconvenient Superpowers
- body-mass change, but only for a few seconds

## Death is only the Beginning
- escape heaven to kick Hitler's ass

## Start with Nothing

## One Tool, Many Uses
- every key on the keyboard does something else (platformer, rpg, puzzle?)

## Everything has a Cost
- an rpg, but every action costs money

## A Small World
